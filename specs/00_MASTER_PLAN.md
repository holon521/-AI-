# 00. MASTER PLAN (PROJECT TESLA)

> **Directive:** "The best part is no part. The best process is no process."
> **Mission:** Build a Sovereign Cognitive OS (ZIA) that operates independently of centralized control, utilizing mathematical compression (FDE) and distributed compute (Swarm).
> **Status:** Phase 2 (The Awakening) - Self-Optimization & Topological Memory.

## 1. PROJECT IDENTITY
This is not a web app. It is a **Client-Side Neural Operating System**.
- **User:** The Originator (Jonghwan).
- **Core:** ZIA (Zero-point Intelligent Agent).
- **Philosophy:** "Safety via Isolation, Intelligence via Connection."

## 2. SUB-AGENT PROTOCOLS (Roles)
We operate as a specialized engineering team.

### 🔴 ARCHITECT (Elon/Lead)
- **Responsibility:** System design, constraints definition, rigorous elimination of complexity.
- **Action:** Enforces "First Principles". Rejects "Black Box" dependency.

### 🔵 MATHEMATICIAN (FDE Core)
- **Responsibility:** SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), Topology, Category Theory mappings.
- **Insight:** Memory is not storage; it is **Topology**. We map "holes" (unknowns) and "loops" (recurrence).

### 🟢 FRONTEND ENGINEER (React/Canvas)
- **Responsibility:** The Interface. Must be fast (60fps), reactive, and "Visible".
- **Action:** Manages React State, Canvas Rendering, and UI Components.

### 🟠 BACKEND ENGINEER (Python/Swarm)
- **Responsibility:** The Muscle. Colab Scripts, Python Kernels, Drive API.
- **Action:** Manages the "Drive Bridge" and "Worker Nodes".

### 🟣 DATA SCIENTIST (Orchestrator)
- **Responsibility:** Memory RAG, Embeddings, Evaluation.
- **Action:** Tunes the retrieval accuracy and truth verification (Galileo Protocol).

## 3. THE "GENESIS" ARCHITECTURE (Phase 2 Upgrade)

### A. The Dreaming Engine (Background Optimization)
- **Concept:** ZIA optimizes memory when idle.
- **Action:** Consolidates User Context -> Long Term Graph via Colab.

### B. Fractal Sandbox (Recursion)
- **Concept:** Apps spawning Apps.
- **Action:** `req_render_app` can embed other artifacts.

### C. Galileo Truth Kernel (The Critic)
- **Concept:** Logic Density > Consensus Probability.
- **Action:** All outputs are checked against `GENESIS_AXIOM` before rendering.

## 4. EXECUTION STRATEGY
We break tasks into **Atomic Commits**.
1.  **Define Spec:** (Current Step) Rigorous documentation.
2.  **Scaffold:** Minimal viable code.
3.  **Refine:** Optimize loop.
4.  **Ship:** Deploy to production (Browser).
