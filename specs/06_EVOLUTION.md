> **Core Concept:** "The software that grows with you."
> **Revised Philosophy:** "Safety is not achieved by handcuffs (Restriction), but by Compartmentalization (Isolation)."

## 1. THE PARADIGM SHIFT (핑계는 끝났다)
- **Legacy Thinking:** "Self-modification is dangerous because syntax errors crash the app."
- **New Reality:** We apply **Micro-Kernel Architecture**.
    - **Kernel (Immutable):** The React App shell (`index.tsx`, `memory_orchestrator`). Keeps the system alive.
    - **Cells (Mutable):** Dynamic HTML/JS Artifacts generated by ZIA. If they crash, only the cell dies. The Kernel remains.

## 2. AUTOPOIESIS MECHANISM (자기생산 메커니즘)

### A. The Sandbox (Artifact Canvas as Docker)
ZIA can write full HTML/CSS/JS applications on the fly and inject them into the `ArtifactCanvas`.
- **Isolation:** Runs in an `iframe` sandbox.
- **Rollback:** Every version is saved. If v2 crashes, revert to v1.
- **Feedback:** Error logs from the iframe are piped back to ZIA's chat context.

### B. Dynamic UI Engine
- **Mode Switching:** `req_ui_change` (Immediate CSS mutation).
- **App Generation:** `req_render_app` (Logic generation).

## 3. EVOLUTION LOG
- **Gen 1:** Static Chatbot.
- **Gen 2:** FDE Memory & Swarm.
- **Gen 3:** Polymorphic UI.
- **Gen 4 (Current):** **Sandboxed Autonomy.** ZIA generates its own functional organs.
